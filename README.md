Puts my friend John (https://github.com/jbott) onto the face of any image you pass it. Uses the C++ OpenCV binding.

Usage: ./ottify <image>

Future work if I feel like it (probably not):
    *Fix face image (leftover background, slightly too high)
    *Add ability to use other faces (face parameter)
    *Add lookup of images by wikipedia/google search etc
