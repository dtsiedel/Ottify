Puts my friend John (https://github.com/jbott) onto the face of any image you pass it. Uses the C++ OpenCV binding.

Usage: ./ottify <image>

Future work if I feel like it (probably not):  
i.   Fix face image (leftover background, slightly too high)  
ii.  Add ability to use other faces (face parameter)  
iii. Add lookup of images by wikipedia/google search etc.  
iv.  Use eye position to orient face when available
